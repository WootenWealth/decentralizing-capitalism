## Thematic Values

Today, we live in a world controlled by corporations, the media, and the banks. It's in this world that financial services, critical thinking, and open entrepreneurship burn in fiery deaths. Without the requisite employment of capital as a means of trade, investment, and liberty, billions like you struggle to prosper.

It is from the pitfalls of this world that Nakamoto promised us an escape from the tyranny of central control. Their creation showed us a path to monetary freedom. But this promise has not been kept.

Recent history showcases the centralization of power, wealth, and attention right back into the hands of these corruptible intermediaries. It is these flaws we can collectively right. And it is people just like you who will lead the charge.

### Individual Sovereignty

In tomorrow's economy, you custody, hold, and spend at will thanks to the promise of these technologies. But there are much larger society-changing forces at work. It's in this journey of change that prudent public policy can come directly from you.

Spearheaded by John Wooten, this show is an ongoing effort to distribute resources back to humans, not faceless corporations, committees, or legislatures. Working together, we can create a free, just, and vast array of goods and services. Thus, we can level the playing field for anyone ambitious enough to put in the work.

This is an adventure towards a future we define where we all have access to the tools presently gatekept for a select few elite. By offering the best abundant communities provide, we can generate a specialized galaxy that knows no bounds. We can shift the balance in a system so clearly controlled by monopolists, plutocrats, and bureaucracies. Quite relevantly, it is based on the principles of [SCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU08km2xrz0&list=PLWUFvhKuc_5u1sQsz-FAmRgFf9HEhyqj-).

### Monetary Unity

Much of the ethos behind the show is based on the use of lumens as the currency. Given the network's efficient decentralization, we can adequately pull the rug out from under established financial intermediaries. That ought to remove the power so concentrated in today's cantillionaire, monopolist, and plutocratic classes.

### Collective Invention

Through open-source licenses, we have the chance to give everyone a fair start in life by using work-product that costs next to nothing to share. By joining forces in our software, thinking, and governing decisions, we can build the best social systems together. ü´±üèª‚Äçü´≤üèø Moreover, we can give the next generation a paper trail to build on thanks to public documentation.

## Movement Organization

Much of these efforts exist in the various free education tools established by this GitHub organization. But the vast majority exists today in your own hands. Indeed, you are the key to change, and this repo/site is designed to give you the most freedom in furthering our shared objectives.

### Referencable Articles

Each episode has its own paired article for later reference. The pages will have a player utility to listen directly, any original descriptions/titles/links, and potential community additions for clarity. These can grow over time to give a punch to any groundbreaking audio you contribute.

### Quotable Transcripts

This is a pending addition. Once we find a simple open-source audio transcriber, a page for each episode will display the transcript. Since it's right in the project, anyone can spellcheck potential mistakes.

### Audio / RSS

`podcast.xml` contains the actual feed fed to any frontend podcast providers. This is where you can place your ideas, voice, and perspectives for all to hear. It also has miscellaneous details for interoperability.
