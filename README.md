## Thematic Values

Today, we live in a world controlled by the corporations, the media, and the banks. It's in this world that financial services, critical thinking, and open euntreprenurship burn in firey deathes. Without the requisite employment of capital as a means of trade, investment, and liberty; billions like you to prosper.

It is from the pitfalls of this world that Nakamoto promised us an escape from the tyranny of central control. Their creation showed us a path to monetary freedom. But this promise has not been kept.

Recent history showcases the centralization of power, wealth, and attention right back into the hands of these corruptable intermediaries. It is these flaws we can collectively right. And it is people just like you that will lead the charge.

### Individual Soverignty

In tommorow's economy, you custody, hold, and spend at will thanks to the promise of these technologies. But there are much larger society-changing forces at work. It's in this journey of change that prudent public policy can come directly from you.

SPearheaded by John Wooten, this show is an ongoing effort to distribute resources back to humans, not faceless corporations, comittees, or legislatures. Working together, we can create a free, just, and vast array of goods and services. Thus, we can level the playing field for anyone ambitious enogh to put in the work.

This is an adventure towards a future we define where we all haver access to the tools presently gaterkeep for a select few elite. By offering the best abundant communities provide, we can generate a specialized galaxy that knows no bounds. We can shift the balance in a system so clearly controlled by monopolists, plutocrats, and beurocracies. Quite relevantly, it is based on the principles of [SCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU08km2xrz0&list=PLWUFvhKuc_5u1sQsz-FAmRgFf9HEhyqj-).
